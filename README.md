### 👋 About Me

Hey there! I'm a full stack software developer with 10+ years of experience in PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, and cloud infrastructure. I previously worked as the Technical Director at Northplanet, a full-service digital agency that specialised in bespoke software, website and ecommerce development, paid advertising, brand identity, and more.

Currently, I work at Jarpa, a software development company that offers custom software solutions to businesses of all sizes. As a Lead Software Developer, I oversee project development, testing, and cloud infrastructure setup. I work closely with our clients to understand their business problems and develop software solutions that increase efficiency and productivity.

When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, or flying FPV drones that I've built in my spare time. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in software development and have a strong understanding of DevOps best practices. I believe that testing is crucial to delivering high-quality software solutions, and I work closely with my team to ensure that we have a comprehensive suite of tests in place.

Feel free to connect with me on Twitter (@danjamesmills) or LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/danieljamesmills/) - I'm always happy to chat!

### 💻 Recent Project

Most of my work is bespoke and under NDA, so not on GitHub. However, I'm always working on exciting projects using the latest technologies and frameworks in web development. Some of my recent work includes:

### 🚀 Internal CRM System Project

As part of my recent work, I had the opportunity to lead the development of an internal CRM system for a insurance service company. The goal was to create a centralised system that would allow the company to manage their customer interactions more effectively and streamline their sales processes.

The CRM system includes a wide range of features, such as:

- **👥 Companies and contacts management:** A comprehensive database of companies and contacts, including custom fields to track specific information relevant to the company's needs. Notes can also be left on companies and contacts.

- **📞 Call logging:** Integration with popular communication providers such as Vonage and 8x8 to log and track call activity, as well as measure call quality metrics.

- **💬 SMS messaging:** Ability to send and receive SMS messages directly from the CRM system.

- **📧 Email integration:** Integration with Gmail and Office 365 to enable seamless email communication and archiving within the CRM system.

- **🔧 Custom dynamic fields:** Ability to create and customise fields for specific data points, allowing for greater flexibility in managing customer information.

- **📈 Sales pipelines:** Customisable sales pipelines to track leads, opportunities, and deals, with the ability to assign tasks and automate follow-ups. Leads are also automatically assigned a "rotting period" to indicate when a lead has not been touched in a while.

- **📝 Task boards and real-time collaboration:** A collaborative platform for teams to manage tasks and work together in real-time. Reminders can also be set to follow up with leads and contacts.

- **💬 Chat and file sharing:** Internal chat functionality and the ability to share files and documents within the CRM system.

- **👤 Staff module:** Staff records management, leave calendar with approvals, and reporting functionality to enable efficient staff management.

- **📊 Accreditation process scoring sheet:** A risk management tool that allows the company to assess and manage the risks associated with their accreditation process.

- **📉 Real-time dashboard reporting:** Real-time reporting dashboards to track key performance indicators and other important metrics, enabling company managers to spot problems and bottlenecks in departments.

- **📑 Registers:** Registers for keeping track of assets, fire drills, and other important information.

- **🚨 Complaints management:** A complaints management system that allows the company to create and track complaints, with review frequency reminders and last review notes.

The real-time reporting and data analysis capabilities of the CRM system have enabled company managers to quickly spot problems and bottlenecks in departments, and take action to address them before they become more significant issues. By having insights into customer behaviour and sales patterns, the company has been able to create more effective marketing campaigns that are data-driven and targeted to specific customer segments.

Since the implementation of the CRM system, the company has seen a significant improvement in productivity, with a reported 70% increase in efficiency. This has resulted in better customer engagement, streamlined operations, and more effective use of data for targeted marketing campaigns. 🎉
